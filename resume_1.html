                    Ross and Smith Islands are known as the Twin Islands of Andaman and Nicobar group of islands. Ross and Smith islands are actually two islands – Ross and Smith joined together to make a single group of islands. These are one of the must watch places in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.These beautiful islands are in North Andaman, few nautical miles from Diglipur Jetty.
                    What makes these islands truly beautiful and sets them apart from the rest of the islands is that these two islands are joined by a natural, sand bar. Its like if you face both the islands, you see a road kinda thing which is actually a sand bar linking both the islands. And thus, while walking on the bar one can move from one island to the other.
